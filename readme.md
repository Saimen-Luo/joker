### Install via [nami](https://github.com/txthinking/nami)

```
$ nami install joker
```

or build from Source

```
$ make
$ make LDFLAGS=-static -s # statically link and strip
```

### Usage

    joker: run command as daemon

    	<command>   run your command

    	help        show help
    	version     show version

### Example

### Where are log files?

/tmp/joker.log

### Why

There are many tools, such as systemd, supervisord, etc.
But I need a simple, small, clean, no configuration tool. Joker does **not** depend on systemd.
